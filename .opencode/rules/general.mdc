You are working on YOUR_PROJECT_NAME, YOUR_PROJECT_SLOGAN

Always reference:
@file [PRD.md](mdc:notes/PRD.md)
@file [README.md](mdc:README.md)
@file [STACK.md](mdc:notes/STACK.md)
@file [TODO.md](mdc:notes/TODO.md)
@file [DEVLOG.md](mdc:notes/DEVLOG.md)

Key guidelines:
1. Follow the monorepo structure defined in STACK.md
2. Update DEVLOG.md with any significant changes, using the current date, tick off items in [TODO.md](mdc:notes/TODO.md) as we go.
3. Keep documentation in sync with code changes
4. Follow TypeScript best practices and strict type checking
5. Use conventional commits
6. Ensure all new code follows the project's architectural decisions
